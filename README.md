## extrap-2.0.tgz

Description: This software extrapolates the work value data obtained from non-equilibrium Jarzynski-type simulations to obtain a more accurate value of the free energy difference.

## interp-1.2.tgz

Description: This software uses polynomial interpolation to fit thermodynamic integration free energy data. The tarball file contained three directories, each with their own set of instructions for use. Our results suggest that use of interpolation reduces the bias and uncertainty of the free energy estimates compared to use of quadrature.

## regress-1.0.tgz

Description: This software uses polynomial regression to fit thermodynamic integration free energy data. The zipped file contains a directory with a set of instructions for use. Our results suggest that use of regression reduces the bias and uncertainty of the free energy estimates compared to use of quadrature.
